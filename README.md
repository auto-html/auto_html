auto_html [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dejan/auto_html.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dejan/auto_html)
=========


auto_html is a Rails extension for transforming URLs to appropriate resource (image, link, YouTube, Vimeo video,...). It's the perfect choice if you don't want to bother visitors with rich HTML editor or markup code, but you still want to allow them to embed video, images, links and more on your site, purely by pasting URL. Check out the [live demo](http://rors.org/demos/auto_html).


## Modified as follows

Altered image filter to make images links so lightbox can hook them.

Also, I don't know what I'm doing ;)
